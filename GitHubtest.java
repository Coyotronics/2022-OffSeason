We programmers, anime watchers, Redditors, etc need to spread the real truth. The real truth of what is beyond our door. Facebook, Twitter, etc are all lies. Reddit is the only true and divine platform. I was once an atheist but once I found Reddit, I knew Reddit was the one and only genuine god. Reddit gave me meaning and purpose. But more than that, it taught me the truth. So now you enlightened souls, spread the truth about grass.");
